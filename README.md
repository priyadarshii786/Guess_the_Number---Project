# Guess_the_Number - Project
<hr>

This interactive game built using the trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript challenges users to guess a secret number, allowing them a total of 5 chances to crack the code.
The HTML structure provides the game's foundation, presenting users with an intuitive interface where they can input their guesses. CSS styles enhance the user experience, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.
The real magic, however, lies in the JavaScript code. It generates a random number as the secret target and keeps track of the user's guesses, deducting one chance with each attempt, it guides users towards the correct answer or informs them when they've exhausted their attempts.
